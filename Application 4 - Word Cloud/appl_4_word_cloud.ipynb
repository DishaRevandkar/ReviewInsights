Honestly people, you should be running a 1-10 ft max to your antenna, with anything longer you are going to be losing too much signal. Search for Rg-174 attenuation... look at the 2.4ghz attenuation and it will be 75db LOSS at 100ft, thats 1.3db loss per foot. Lesson learned here. If you are looking for better reception of your wireless router, use one of the simple DIY aluminum parabolic reflectors on one of your antennas directly at your router -- thats what i did to remedy my router issue.  The one star was because this cable will do nothing for you at 2.4ghz, it is a pure waste of money, anyone saying they got better reception is full of crap.

I was excited but---as things transpired the router had to be put on the floor vs up on top of  an bookcase where the old one was.  The old one had no antennas and looked very insignificant, and this new router was very easy to see.  So putting it on the floor made the wifi reception terrible, and unacceptable.

They screw on where the antenna screwed on.  Then I routed them up to the ceiling and checked the wifi signal strength.  Now its back to 5 bars.

The connectors on this cable are of high quality and the length is very generous.  I've been using it continually now for a couple of months and haven't had an issue.<br /><br />The only thing to consider is that because the cable is so long, there is a bit of a drop in signal strength (around 5-6 percent it seems) due to the natural resistance of the cable.  This is a non-issue to me due to the quality of the antenna to which it is connected but others may find that useful.\", 'I was getting ready to move my wireless router to a more central location in the house so that every room had good wireless access, when I saw this $5 cable.  What a life saver!  I figured spending $5 bucks on something that might work was worth it, so it came in and I had it installed in 2 seconds.

Any gains from antenna location change were off set by the signal loss caused by the cable.  The longer the cable the more signal loss.  What this cable did allow for is locating the router in location where the antenna would not fit.', 'I received this 5 meter antenna extension cable quickly after ordering from Amazon.  It\\'s nicely constructed and appears to use quality materials.<br /><br />I know that antenna cables are subject to signal loss in correlation to their length, and some of the $25+ cables are described as \\\\\\\\\"low loss\\\\\\\\\" cables, and some define the amount of loss to expect.  Many cables indicate a loss range of .7 or greater dB per meter of length, so you want to use the shortest cable possible.<br /><br />I tested the wifi signal strength of this 5 meter extension cable (before and after installation) using inSSIDer Wifi Analyzer software on my Windows 7 desktop.  The extension cable was connected to a [[ASIN:B0007XXU3E D-Link  ANT24-0700 2.4 GHz Omni-Directional 7 dBi Indoor Antenna]].  The drop in signal was about 5dB using the cable, and the gain from moving the D-Link Antenna to a better location in the room using the extension cable was about 5dB.  So, for me, there was not a benefit when connected to the D-Link ANT24-0700.<br /><br />Then, I connected it to one of the three \\'standard\\' 4\\\\\\\\\" antenna that came with my wireless adapter card ([[ASIN:B000N4WRFY D-Link DWA-556 Xtreme N PCI Express Desktop Adapter]]).  By moving one of the three \\'standard\\' 4\\\\\\\\\" connectors to a better location using this 5 meter extension cable, I was able to gain about 3 dB.<br /><br />My suggestion is that you use a Wifi Analyzer on your cell phone (such as Wifi Analyzer by farproc for Android) to first test various locations that are within 5 meters of your current antenna\\'s location.  If you can pick up more than 5 dB of gain in a better location, this 5 meter extension cable may be a worthwhile option.  Otherwise, I would recommend getting a better antenna, or trying out a Range Extender.', 'Great quality, fits perfect in the antena and wifi router. It´s the right thing to purchase if you need your wifi antenna in the different location than your wifi router.', 'This is a quality cable with gold colored ends.  It was packed well and came new and in good condition.  I had an initial problem with my end using this cable to extend an existing cable. Bestumart worked with me over several emails, that included photos, to find a solution. They have excellent customer service and I appreciate that they went over and beyond to assist. Thank you!', 'I bought this to give  me some length on my wifi antenna. I was able to extend the length of the connecting wire and more my antenna to a better position. Signal is up by about 50%. Great Product!', 'I needed this because I have a wireless PC in my room. I needed this because I wanted to place the PC in an area where the reception for most wireless electronics (including wi-fi) is blocked. This completely fixed my problem and now I get a perfect signal! Highly recommended!']\n"

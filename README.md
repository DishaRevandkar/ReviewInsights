# Amazon Customer Reviews Data Analysis 

Overview

This project involves the analysis of Amazon customer reviews, leveraging a dataset comprising over 130 million customer reviews for various products spanning from 1994. The goal is to gain insights into the dataset using various data analysis and visualization techniques.

Dataset Overview

The dataset includes attributes such as `customer_id`, `product_id`, `product_category`, `star_rating`, `total_votes`, `review_date`, and others. The dataset is available in Tab Separated Values (.tsv) format and spans from 1994.

Data Analysis Techniques

The project employs various data analysis techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Decision Trees), sentiment analysis, and regression techniques.

Implemented Applications

1. *Sentimental Analysis of Product Reviews:*
   - Machine learning algorithms used: Linear Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes.
   - Results include accuracy scores, precision scores, f-1 scores, and confusion matrices.

2. *Determining Product Quality Based on Reviews Using Word Cloud:*
   - Word clouds are used to visualize the frequency of words in reviews, providing insights into product quality.

3. *Identifying Top 10 / Bottom 10 Products in a Specific Category:*
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is utilized to identify the top and bottom products in the Electronics category.

4. *Classification of Products Based on Star Ratings and Helpfulness:*
   - Products are classified as helpful or unhelpful based on star ratings and helpful votes.

Data Pre-processing

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Understand data characteristics, including data validity, accuracy, and completeness.
   - Utilize statistical analysis and data visualization techniques.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Remove irrelevant and duplicate data.
   - Convert data types and fix missing values.

3. Data Transformation:
   - Create a new attribute for sentiment analysis.

Data Management System

The project utilizes PostgreSQL as the Data Management System for storing and processing the dataset.

Analysis Results include:

- Accuracy scores, precision scores, f-1 scores, and confusion matrices for sentiment analysis algorithms.

Visualization

- Visualizations include word clouds, bar charts, and pie charts for better understanding of the dataset.
